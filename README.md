# BOHO - Static MVP

BOHO (Be Fearless Be Boho) is a modern booking platform for unique accommodations around the world. This repository contains a static MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that showcases the key features and user interface of the platform.

## Overview

This static MVP demonstrates the look and feel of the BOHO platform without requiring backend functionality. It's designed to be a visual and interactive representation of what the full application would offer.
